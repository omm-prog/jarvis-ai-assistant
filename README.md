## üéØ Features

- **Voice Commands:** Perform tasks like opening applications, searching the web, and setting reminders using natural voice inputs.
- **IoT Integration:** Control IoT devices with simple commands.
- **Web Automation:** Perform web searches and retrieve results instantly.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Jarvis responds in a natural, human-like voice.
- **Customizable:** Add new commands and functions as needed.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or above
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omm-prog/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-ai-assistant
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py

 ## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Jarvis uses `SpeechRecognition`** to convert voice input into text.
2. Based on the command, Jarvis performs the following tasks:
   - Opens applications.
   - Conducts web searches.
   - Controls IoT devices.
   - Sets reminders or alarms.
3. Jarvis responds with appropriate output using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion.
